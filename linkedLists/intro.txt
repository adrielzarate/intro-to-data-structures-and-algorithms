Linked List Data Structure in JavaScript
A linked list is a collection of items where each item points to the next one in the list. Because of this structure, linked lists are very slow when searching for an item at a particular index. An array, by comparison, has quick `get`s when searching for an index, but a linked list must start at the beginning, often called the "head", and loop through each item's `next` property until we arrive at the item. This makes `get`s in a linked list an operation that takes `O(n)` time. While `get`s might be slow in a linked list, it's other operations, like `push` and `delete` come with some great benefits we will see in the lesson.
